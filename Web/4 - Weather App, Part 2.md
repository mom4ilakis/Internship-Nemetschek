# Getting started with React.js :)

## 1. Setup
... a React project and look around. Check out what Webpack and Babel are. A simple config of what you need can be found here: [simple-webpack-config](https://github.com/vkolova/simple-webpack-conf)

## 2. Remember that Web App?
No one really uses console apps anymore, right? Create a real-time weather app in React. Make it as fancy as you like.
